# Valion Assessment

Welcome to our test repository!
It contains our tests for all the Data-Enthusiasts and believers who are motivated to join the Valion team.

You will see three folders that represent different tests made by our team members.
It's a good way to get to know our team in a technical way and show us your potential value to the team.

Guidelines for the test :

- [ ] You have **14 days** to send in your submission for the application
- [ ] The 14 days start the moment you send me a confirmation e-mail.
- [ ] The goal is to finish **at least 2 out of 3 cases**
- [ ] The **General_Questions** are mandatory
- [ ] You are free to choice your second topic for your submission
- [ ] If you really want to impress, feel free to do all 3 :) But bear in mind, **QUALITY OVER QUANTITY**
- [ ] **Don't forget to have fun while doing the assignment. If you enjoy your job, you will excel and provide quality work !**


Thank you for your interest in Valion and good luck with the assignment !
